## Countdown to 2026 â€” My First JavaScript Project

This is a **countdown timer** that tracks the time remaining until **January 1, 2026** â€” and it's my first project using **JavaScript**! ðŸš€
I built it to practice DOM manipulation, time calculations, and responsive web design.

### Features

- **Live Countdown**: Updates every second to show the exact number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.
- **Progress Bar**: Visually shows how much of the time span between Jan 1, 2025, and Jan 1, 2026, has passed.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks clean and works well across desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle transitions and a radial background for a polished look.

### Tech Stack

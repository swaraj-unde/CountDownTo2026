# ⏳ Countdown to 2026

This is a **countdown timer** that tracks the time remaining until **January 1, 2026** — and it's my **first project using JavaScript**! 🚀  
I built it to practice DOM manipulation, time calculations, and responsive web design.

### ✨ Features

- **Live Countdown**: Updates every second to show the exact number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.
- **Progress Bar**: Visually shows how much of the time span between Jan 1, 2025, and Jan 1, 2026, has passed.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes subtle transitions and a vibrant radial gradient background.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML** — Page structure  
- **CSS** — Styling and responsiveness (media queries, gradients, flexbox)  
- **JavaScript** — Logic for time calculations, live updates, and DOM manipulation
